Q: If no one else were watching, what kind of work would you choose to do?
D: Imagine there were no expectations from your boss, your family, your LinkedIn followers, or even your past self. If you could just do the kind of work that lights you up—without needing to explain or justify it—what would that be? This question helps uncover your true passions and motivations, free from external noise. It’s not about the job title or status, but the kind of tasks, problems, or environments that bring you alive.

Q: What assumptions have you made about what success 'should' look like in your career—and where did those assumptions come from?
D: We often inherit definitions of success without realizing it—like climbing the corporate ladder, getting a certain title, or reaching a particular income level. Take a moment to reflect: Who or what shaped your vision of success? Was it a parent, mentor, culture, or industry standard? Are those definitions still serving you—or is it time to redefine what success looks like on your terms?

Q: Where do your natural strengths take you—if you follow them without trying to fit into a predefined role?
D: Instead of starting with a job title or career path, start with you. What are you naturally great at? What types of problems do you enjoy solving? If you followed those strengths, without worrying about fitting into someone else’s org chart, what kind of roles or opportunities might emerge? This is where your authentic value proposition lives—often in places you didn’t expect.
