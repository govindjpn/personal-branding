Welcome to your personal brand discovery journey! To help us understand your unique professional identity, please share the following information:

Quick Start: Tell Me a Bit About You

So I can ask you the right questions to uncover and shape your personal brand.  You can also upload some documents about yourself, like your resume, goals you might have captured, etc.  

Just a few short answers will go a long way! No pressure to write essays—just give me the basics and I’ll take it from there.

1. Who are you professionally (or who do you want to become)?
(e.g., a student studying marketing, a jazz musician, a UX designer, a public speaker, a teacher looking to switch careers, etc.)

2. What’s one goal or dream you're working toward right now?
(This could be related to career, visibility, impact, income, or even switching paths.)

3. What makes you unique—or what do you want to be known for?
(Don't worry if it's not crystal clear—just give me what comes to mind.)

4. Who do you want to reach or influence with your personal brand?
(e.g., employers, fans, recruiters, clients, collaborators, industry peers, the general public, etc.)

Once I have this, I’ll shape follow-up questions that are relevant to you—so we can build a brand that feels authentic, strategic, and aligned with your goals.
